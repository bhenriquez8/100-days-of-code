# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started a ReactJs Project that submits to Firebase back-end.

**Thoughts:** Setting up firebase was simple enough, but the object I created wasn't too complicated. Also questioning
if it's good practice to have the config in one of my files with the API key exposed.

### Day 1: April 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Changed up the UI to implement React Router. Got a component to read from firebase to update a
CardView.
