# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started a ReactJs Project that submits to Firebase back-end.

**Thoughts:** Setting up firebase was simple enough, but the object I created wasn't too complicated. Also questioning
if it's good practice to have the config in one of my files with the API key exposed.

### Day 1: April 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Changed up the UI to implement React Router. Got a component to read from firebase to update a
CardView.

**Thoughts:** Meant to say something here yesterday. I wanted to implements more notes and have them displayed on a
grid.

## Day 2: April 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Changed up the side panel to be more aesthetically pleasing. Attempted to make the grid with
Materialize framework.

**Thoughts:** Materialize's responsiveness is impressive, but need to better understand it to have it diplayed the way I
want. Tomorrow I'll be sure to have it look better and think of other features to add to my web app.

## Day 3: April 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created a Wikipedia search engine SPA using ReactJs. Based on freeCodeCamp's Intermediate level
projects for their front-end development certificate.

**Thoughts**: Struggled a bit trying to figure out what's the best practice for handling states and passing props to
components that need to handle API calls. Joined in on a communnity chat of ReactJs coders for assistance.
